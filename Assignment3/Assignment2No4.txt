#In this instance, I displayed the category name, as well as the product name. I was somewhat confused by what c) meant. The
#inital part of the question made sense, but the rest didn't, so I presumed that it meant by saying that I had to find sum of
#(category_name*product_name) and display that information as "OrderDetails". I also tried to sum up the amount of products within
#category and was able to do so, but the total was displayed down at the bottom of the "Products Within Each Category" column.
#I wasn't able to isolate that result from the rest of the data shown- Nick
