#I found that in this problem, I had to combine three different tables to get all of the information I needed. I needed to
#combine the order_items, the customers, and the orders table. I then implemented a few formulas that would calculate the cost 
#of the items, the amount of items bought, and the cost of the orders. I didn't exactly understand what the question meant by asking
#for the customer total for each customer and the customer total from the columns in the Order_Items table, so I might have went a
#bit overboard with the amount of information I listed out. Regardless, I think I answered everything that the question asked of me
